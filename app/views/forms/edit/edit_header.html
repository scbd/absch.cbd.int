                <div>Parties requiring prior informed consent (PIC) are to provide for the issuance of a permit or its equivalent at the time of access as evidence of the decision to grant PIC and of the establishment of mutually agreed terms (MAT) (Article

                <div>Article 17, paragraph 2, provides that a permit or its equivalent issued in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 3(e), and made available to the ABS Clearing-House, shall constitute an internationally recognized certificate of compliance

                <br>
                <div>Article 17, paragraph 3, further establishes that the internationally recognized certificate of compliance shall serve as evidence that the genetic resource which it covers has been accessed in accordance with PIC and that MAT have been
                    established, as required by the domestic access and benefit sharing legislation or regulatory requirements of the Party providing prior informed consent.</div>
                <br>
                <div>Article 17, paragraph 4, provides that the internationally recognized certificate of compliance shall contain the following minimum information when it is not confidential:</div>

                </ul>
                <br>
                <div>In accordance with the above, Parties are required to fill out the form. At a minimum, the mandatory fields should be filled out with the information contained in the permit (or its equivalent) issued at national level. If information

                <div>Once this information is published in the ABS Clearing-House, an internationally recognized certificate of compliance is issued/constituted. The ABS Clearing-House will then send a courtesy copy of the internationally recognized certificate

                <div>
                    <p>Article 29 of the Nagoya Protocol provides that each Party shall monitor the implementation of its obligations under the Protocol, and shall, at intervals and in the format to be determined by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol (COP-MOP), report to the COP-MOP on measures that it has taken to implement the Protocol.</p>
                    <p>The COP-MOP agreed on guidelines and format for submission and requested Parties to submit an interim national report on the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, twelve months prior to the third meeting of the COP-MOP and through the ABS Clearing-House.  Non-Parties are welcome to submit relevant information (decision NP-1/3).</p>
                    <p class="bold color-yellow">The deadline for submission is 1 November 2017.</p>
                </div><br>
                <h5> Why is it important to submit the interim national report?</h5>
                <div>
                    <p>The information received through these reports will assist the COP-MOP in reviewing the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol and to make the decisions necessary to promote its effective implementation.  In this regard the interim national reports will be one of the main sources of information, together with the ABS Clearing-House, for conducting the first assessment and review of the effectiveness of the Protocol and the information provided will inform and will be taken into account in the consideration of a number of issues by COP-MOP 3 and other subsidiary bodies.</p>
                    <p>In addition, submitting the interim national report can help Parties, as well as non-Parties to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess the level of implementation of the Nagoya Protocol and identify gaps in implementation;</li>
                            <li>Serve as a checklist of the obligations of the Protocol;</li>
                            <li>Identify gaps and needs in terms of capacity, and thus contribute to a more effective design of capacity-building activities and resources;</li>
                            <li>Share experiences, challenges and solutions among countries in relation to the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, and therefore help Identifying good practices and constraints in implementation of the Nagoya Protocol.</li>
                        </ul>
