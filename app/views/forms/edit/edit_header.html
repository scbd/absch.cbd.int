                <div>Parties requiring prior informed consent (PIC) are to provide for the issuance of a permit or its equivalent at the time of access as evidence of the decision to grant PIC and of the establishment of mutually agreed terms (MAT) (Article
                    3, paragraph 3(e)). This information is to be made available to the ABS Clearing-House in accordance with Article 14, paragraph 2(c).</div>
                <br>
                <div>Article 17, paragraph 2, provides that a permit or its equivalent issued in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 3(e), and made available to the ABS Clearing-House, shall constitute an internationally recognized certificate of compliance
                    (IRCC).&nbsp;</div>
                <br>
                <div>Article 17, paragraph 3, further establishes that the internationally recognized certificate of compliance shall serve as evidence that the genetic resource which it covers has been accessed in accordance with PIC and that MAT have been
                    established, as required by the domestic access and benefit sharing legislation or regulatory requirements of the Party providing prior informed consent.</div>
                <br>
                <div>Article 17, paragraph 4, provides that the internationally recognized certificate of compliance shall contain the following minimum information when it is not confidential:</div>

                <br>
                <div>In accordance with the above, Parties are required to fill out the form. At a minimum, the mandatory fields should be filled out with the information contained in the permit (or its equivalent) issued at national level. If information

                <div>Once this information is published in the ABS Clearing-House, an internationally recognized certificate of compliance is issued/constituted. The ABS Clearing-House will then send a courtesy copy of the internationally recognized certificate

                <h5> Background</h5>
                <div>
                    <p>Article 29 of the Nagoya Protocol provides that each Party shall monitor the implementation of its obligations under the Protocol, and shall, at intervals and in the format to be determined by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol (COP-MOP), report to the COP-MOP on measures that it has taken to implement the Protocol.</p>
                    <p>The COP-MOP agreed on guidelines and format for submission and requested Parties to submit an interim national report on the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, twelve months prior to the third meeting of the COP-MOP and through the ABS Clearing-House.  Non-Parties are welcome to submit relevant information (decision NP-1/3).</p>
                    <p class="bold color-yellow">The deadline for submission is 1 November 2017.</p>
                </div><br>
                <h5> Why is it important to submit the interim national report?</h5>
                <div>
                    <p>The information received through these reports will assist the COP-MOP in reviewing the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol and to make the decisions necessary to promote its effective implementation.  In this regard the interim national reports will be one of the main sources of information, together with the ABS Clearing-House, for conducting the first assessment and review of the effectiveness of the Protocol and the information provided will inform and will be taken into account in the consideration of a number of issues by COP-MOP 3 and other subsidiary bodies.</p>
                    <p>In addition, submitting the interim national report can help Parties, as well as Non-Parties to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess the level of implementation of the Nagoya Protocol and identify gaps in implementation;</li>
                            <li>Serve as a checklist of the obligations of the Protocol;</li>
                            <li>Identify gaps and needs in terms of capacity, and thus contribute to a more effective design of capacity-building activities and resources;</li>
                            <li>Share experiences, challenges and solutions among countries in relation to the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, and therefore help Identifying good practices and constraints in implementation of the Nagoya Protocol.</li>
                        </ul>

                <div>Articles 19 and 20 of the Protocol require each Party to encourage, as appropriate, the development, update and use of sectoral and cross-sectoral model contractual clauses for mutually agreed terms, as well as voluntary codes of conduct,
                    guidelines and best practices and/or standards in relation to access and benefit-sharing. These tools can serve to promote legal certainty and transparency, and reduce transaction costs in the implementation of ABS requirements, while
                    taking into account the practices of different sectors.</div>

                    Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Nagoya Protocol provides that Parties, in implementing their obligations under the Protocol, shall in accordance with domestic law take into consideration indigenous and local communities’ customary laws, community protocols
                    and procedures, as applicable, with respect to traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources. Furthermore, Parties are to endeavour to support, as appropriate, the development by indigenous and local communities of community
                    protocols in relation to access to traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources and benefits arising out of the utilization of such knowledge (Article 12, paragraph 3, (a)).

                <div>Article 22 of the Nagoya Protocol provides that Parties shall cooperate in the capacity-building, capacity development and strengthening of human resources and institutional capacities to effectively implement the Protocol in developing
                    country Parties, including existing global, regional, subregional and national institutions and organizations. In this context, Parties should also facilitate the involvement of indigenous and local communities and relevant stakeholders,

                <br>
                <div>Article 22, paragraph 6, provides that information on capacity-building and development initiatives at national, regional, international levels should be provided to the ABS Clearing-House with a view of promoting synergy and coordination

                <br>
                <div>Having all information on capacity-building projects and initiatives available in one database can provide opportunities for coordination among actors involved in capacity-building in the same geographical area or covering similar thematic
                    issues and to learn from each other experiences. It can also help to identify and address gaps and overlaps in the coverage of capacity-building initiatives.</div>
