                                                        series of questions based on those provisions of the Protocol that
                                                        establish obligations for the Parties to the Protocol. These

                                                        in the reporting format to contribute to the assessment and review

                                                        and to identify challenges and difficulties in implementing the
                                                        Protocol, and of decisions adopted by the Conference of the Parties
                                                        serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Nagoya Protocol

                                                    <p>The interim national report can be a useful tool for both Parties
                                                        and Non-Parties to assess the level of implementation of the Nagoya
                                                        Protocol, as well as gaps and needs in terms of capacity, and will
                                                        assist the COP-MOP in reviewing, on a regular basis, the
                                                        implementation of the Nagoya Protocol and to make, within its
                                                        mandate, the decisions necessary to promote its effective
                                                        implementation in accordance with Article 26, paragraph 4.</p>
    
                                                    <p>Information submitted through the interim national report could also
                                                        serve to share experiences, challenges and solutions among
                                                        countries in relation to the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol.
                                                        In this regard, the interim national report can be a valuable tool
                                                        for building and developing capacity to implement the Protocol and
                                                        for designing capacity-building activities more effectively. The
                                                        format is intended to minimize the reporting burden on countries
                                                        and therefore questions are simple in nature (usually yes or no
                                                        questions). Generally, these questions are followed by text entries
                                                        where countries are encouraged to provide details on the measures
                                                        taken as well as to report on difficulties and challenges to
                                                        implement particular provisions of the Protocol and to provide
                                                        further information on the issue by linking to existing Access and

                                                        websites or uploading documents. This is an opportunity to identify
                                                        good practices and constraints in implementation of the Nagoya

                                                        different sections of the interim national report if they wish to
                                                        do so, or else the Secretariat when consolidating information for

                                                        contained in the interim national report will also include relevant
                                                        information already published in the ABS Clearing-House.</p>

                                                        respondents are invited to ensure that answers are as relevant and
                                                        as succinct as possible.</p>
    
                                                    <p>Countries are invited to submit any other information in the section
                                                        provided at the end of the reporting format. The Executive
                                                        Secretary welcomes any comments on the adequacy of the questions
                                                        and difficulties in completing the questions, and any further
                                                        recommendations on how these reporting guidelines could be
                                                        improved.</p>
    
                                                    <p>It is recommended that Parties involve all relevant stakeholders in
                                                        the preparation of the report in order to ensure a participatory

                                                    <p>Countries should use the online version of the format, unless
                                                        technically not feasible, and to submit the report through the ABS
                                                        Clearing-House while ensuring that the national information on the
                                                        ABS Clearing-House is up-to-date.</p>
    
                                                    <p>Only if not technically feasible, Parties should resort to offline
                                                        submissions to the ABS Clearing-House. Offline submissions should
                                                        use the protected form, as provided for download on the ABS
                                                        Clearing-House in MS Word format.  It is recommended that countries
                                                        send the report via email to the Secretariat (secretariat@cbd.int),
                                                        and include a scanned copy of the last page signed by the ABS

                                                        Secretary will assist Parties in making their report available on
