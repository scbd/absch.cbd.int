                      <p>
                            Any person can have a CBD account which will give you access to register information in all CBD
                            clearing-houses including the Biosafety Clearing-House (BCH), the ABS Clearing-House (ABS-CH)
                            and the clearing-house mechanism (CHM) under the Convention. You can  register for a
                            CBD account at <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="http://accounts.cbd.int/signin">accounts.cbd.int/signin</a>
                      </p>

                            Make sure you enter all the information required as instructed on the form. You’ll automatically
                            receive an e-mail with a link you have to click to confirm your account.
                     </p>

                      <h1> I am not sure if my account is still active?</h1>
                      <p>
                        The easiest way to check if you are registered accounts.cbd.int is to go to the
                        <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="https://accounts.cbd.int/password/reset">forgot password page</a> and enter the email
                        associated with that account. If you have an account you will be emailed by the system a link to re-activate your password.
