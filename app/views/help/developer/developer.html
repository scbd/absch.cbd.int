                    <h1>ABSCH for developers (api.cbd.int)</h1>
                    <p>The ABS Clearing-House has been designed to be interoperable and facilitate the exchange of information with other databases and systems, in particular Parties’ databases, as well as databases of other instruments and organizations</p>

                   <p> With this aim, the Secretariat has developed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_new">application programming interface (API)</a>. The API is the main tool to facilitate interoperability and the exchange of information with other IT systems or databases, in particular the IT systems of Parties. The API provides a standard interface described by a set of standard protocols to facilitate interaction with computer systems. The API is meant to allow the seamless integration of the data and functionality of the ABSCH, in order to avoid duplication, into other systems in ways that best fit their own needs, workflows and technologies.</p>
