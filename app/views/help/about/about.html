                           The Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House (ABS-CH) is a platform for exchanging information on access and benefit-sharing established by Article 14 of the Protocol, as part of Clearing-House under Article 18, paragraph 3 of the Convention. The ABS Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, by enhancing legal certainty and transparency on procedures for access, and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along the value chain, including through the internationally recognized certificate of compliance. By hosting relevant information regarding ABS, the Clearing-House will offer opportunities for connecting users and providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           Parties are to provide and update the <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="/help/about?question=obligations">information required under the Protocol</a> through this information-exchange system.

                       <h1>What is the relationship between the ABS-CH and the clearing-house mechanisms of the CBD?</h1>
                       <div>
                         <p>
                             The ABS-CH is established as part of the clearing-house mechanism (CHM) of the Convention.
                             The CHM (<a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="http://chm.cbd.int" target="_blank">http://chm.cbd.int</a>) has been developed
                             as a single and unified platform which also supports the dedicated clearing-houses of the Cartagena
                             Protocol on Biosafety (BCH) and the Nagoya Protocol (ABS-CH).
                             You can access all clearing-houses with the same CBD account that you can get from (<a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="http://accounts.cbd.int" target="_blank">http://accounts.cbd.int</a>).
                         </p>

                         <p>
                             However, each of the clearing-houses has a dedicated portal for searching and registering information in order to
                             respond to the specific needs of the Parties with regards to implementation of the different treaties.
                         </p>

                           <p>
                            The CHM of the Convention was established in accordance with <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-18" target="_blank">Article 18(3)</a> of the Convention to promote and
                            facilitate technical and scientific cooperation on all biodiversity issues. The ABS-CH, on the other hand, was
                            established under <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14" target="_blank">Article 14 </a> of the Nagoya Protocol with a special focus on the information that must be exchanged
                            under the Protocol. The ABS-CH plays a key role in supporting implementation of the Protocol by contributing to
                            transparency and certainty on procedures for access and monitoring of the utilization of genetic resources.
                            Because of this role, the ABS-CH has some characteristics, features and functions which are specific to this portal.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                             Another major difference between the CHM and the ABS-CH is that, with regards to the latter,
                             <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14" target="_blank">Article 14</a> of the Protocol
                             enumerates a variety of <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="/help/about?question=obligations">categories of information</a> which Parties to the Protocol are legally obliged to provide through
                             the ABS-CH. There are no such legal requirements for Parties to the Convention to make information available through the CHM.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                             <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="/help/about?question=common_formats">Common formats</a> and rules of operation need to be compatible and, where possible, harmonized across the clearing-houses. The common
                              formats developed for the ABS Clearing-House make use, as much as possible,
                             of predefined text or <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="/help/about?question=controlled_vocabulary">controlled vocabularies</a> that are compatible with the controlled vocabularies of the CHM and the BCH.

                       <div>
                         <p>
                             Although free text searches are easy to implement and carry out, problems sometimes arise when retrieving the full
                             range of results from the incorporation of information in various languages, the use of synonyms and inconsistent
                             terminology and spelling. Therefore, where appropriate, the ABS Clearing-House makes use of a controlled vocabulary,
                             in order to facilitate the future ability to conduct searches in a number of different languages and return consistent
                             search results. This is essentially a thesaurus of standardized words used to search and register information with the
                             database in the ABS Clearing-House. Controlled vocabularies have been developed in harmony across the wider CBD clearinghouse
                             mechanisms, with a view to enabling searches of information.

                         <p>
                             The ABS-CH makes use of metadata. This are descriptive information used to identify the ABS-CH record.
                             Some metadata are created automatically when information is submitted to the ABS-CH, such as the owner of the record,
                             the status of the record, the date of submission as well as the category of the common format used.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             In addition to the automatically generated metadata, the person registering the records will also be expected to supply
                             additional metadata to describe the information in the records by selecting descriptive terms from a list of predefined
                             keywords (e.g. the elements describing the content of a legislative measure chosen from a <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="/help/about?question=controlled_vocabulary">controlled vocabulary</a>).  The
                             collection of this information is meant to facilitate the registration and retrieval of information in the ABS-CH.

                         <p>
                             It is preferable that the information is registered online through the <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="/register">register information</a> page.
                             However, users with limited Internet access may complete <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="/help/about?question=common_formats">offline common formats</a> and submit them,
                             duly signed by the publishing authority, to the Secretariat by email or fax (however, common formats
                             should only be faxed if sending them by email is impossible).  The Secretariat would then register offline
                             submissions of information in the ABS Clearing-House on behalf of Parties.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                             Parties with limited Internet access can request the Secretariat to provide an offline version of the ABS-CH in a portable data storage device (this service is not currenly availbable yet).

                         <p>
                             During the pilot-phase, the ABS Clearing-House has been operating in English. However,
                             in the next biennium the ABS-CH will be operative in the six official languages of the United Nations.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                             The common formats have to be completed in one of the official UN languages. Nevertheless, users can include documents or attachments in any language.

                         <p>

                             encourage Non-Parties to adhere to the Protocol and to contribute appropriate information to the ABS-CH.
                             This issue has  also been discussed during the ABSCH IAC meeting and there was common understanding that Non-Parties to
                             the Protocol could publish records in the ABS-CH but that a country’s status as a Party or Non-Party
                             should be indicated in the record.</p>

                        <p>The practice during the pilot phase has been to allow equal participation of Parties to the CBD in the ABS-CH.
                            The difference would be that a Non-Party to the Protocol would not be legally required to comply
                            with the obligations provided by <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14" target="_blank">Article 14</a>.

                       <p>
                           Therefore, currently any record published by a duly designated publishing authority will remain in the

                           Article 10 of the Nagoya Protocol requires the Parties to consider the need for and modalities of a global multilateral benefit-sharing mechanism to address the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from the utilization of genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources that occur in transboundary situations or for which it is not possible to grant or obtain prior informed consent. <br><br>The article also states that benefits shared by users of genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources through this mechanism shall be used to support the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components globally.<br> <br>In decision XI/1, the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity mandated a number of activities concerning Article 10 of the Nagoya Protocol to take place during the current inter-sessional period. This portal on Article 10 is intended to provide up-to-date information on these activities.<br> <br>
                           The online discussion groups on Article 10 are now complete. All the messages posted during the discussions will remain available through the <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="https://bch.cbd.int/abs/art10_groups/">'Discussion groups'</a> page. <br><br>The next step in the process mandated by decision XI/1 is the expert group meeting. Participants in the expert group on Article 10 will be selected from among those who took part in the online discussion groups and will be notified in due course. <br><br>The expert group meeting will be held from 17 to 19 September 2013 in Montreal.

                         <p>Article 14 of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization establishes an Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House (ABS Clearing-House) as part of the clearing-house mechanism under Article 18, paragraph 3 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).
                         </p>
                         <p>In accordance with recommendation 1/1 of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Intergovernmental Committee for the Nagoya Protocol (the Intergovernmental Committee), the Executive Secretary is currently implementing the pilot phase of the ABS Clearing-House based on the guidance set out in the annex to recommendation 1/1 and in recommendation 2/4. In addition, the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention endorsed an indicative work plan and timeline for activities to take place until the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol (COP-MOP), as contained in document UNEP/CBD/COP/11/11 (decision XI/1 C, paragraph 2).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                         In paragraph 1 of decision XI/1 C, the Conference of the Parties established an informal advisory committee (IAC) to assist the Executive Secretary with the implementation of the pilot phase of the ABS Clearing-House and to provide technical guidance with respect to the resolution of technical issues arising from the ongoing development of the pilot phase until the first meeting of the Parties to the Protocol. The decision provided that the IAC should be regionally balanced and composed of fifteen experts selected on the basis of nominations provided by Parties.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                         In paragraph 3 of this decision, the Conference of the Parties decided that the IAC would hold one meeting, subject to the availability of financial resources, and informal online discussions, as needed, and report on the outcomes of its work to the third meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee. Thanks to the generous financial support of the European Union, the meeting of the IAC was held in <a rel="noopener" translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/?meeting=ABS-IAC-CH-01">Montreal, from 2 to 4 October 2013</a>.

                                   facilitate the consistent registering and retrieval of information in the ABS-CH.

                              Common formats are available online in the register information page and offline in MS word format
