        <div class="title">The Provider Country: Middle-earth</div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>This is the National Focal Point and publishing authority(PA) for the ABS-CH working for the National Government of the Middle-earth, in the Ministry of Environment</p>

            <p>Middle-earth is widely known to be rich in magic genetic resources. Middle-earth’s population encompasses several independent groups of elves local communities. Magic genetic resources are important economically as well as culturally and traditionally for the Middle-earth and its local communities. Many magic genetic resources and their wild relatives are found in elves’ territories. The elves local communities are the main caretakers of Middle-earth’s magic genetic resources and the sole holders of the associated magic knowledge. These genetic resources and the ecosystems where they grow and flourish also provide many wide ranging national and global socio-economic and environmental benefits,  from contributing to the fight against climate change to supporting the basic magic needs of the most marginalized and vulnerable of Middle-earth’s population, like the Hobbits</p>
