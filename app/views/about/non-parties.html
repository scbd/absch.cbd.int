    <h1> I am not a Party, can I still publish information on the ABS-CH?</h1>
    <div>

      <p>
          <a href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-24" target="_new">Article 24</a> of the Protocol provides that Parties shall
          encourage non-Parties to adhere to the Protocol and to contribute appropriate information to the ABS-CH.
          This issue has  also been discussed during the ABSCH IAC meeting and there was common understanding that non-Parties to
          the Protocol could publish records in the ABS-CH but that a country’s status as a Party or non-Party
          should be indicated in the record.</p>

     <p>The practice during the pilot phase has been to allow equal participation of Parties to the CBD in the ABS-CH.
         The difference would be that a non-Party to the Protocol would not be legally required to comply
         with the obligations provided by <a href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-24" target="_new">Article 14</a>.
         </p>

    <p>
        Therefore, currently any record published by a duly designated publishing authority will remain in the
        ABS-CH until it is deleted by the PA.
