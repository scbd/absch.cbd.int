                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p> The Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House (ABS Clearing-House, ABSCH) is a platform for exchanging information on access and benefit-sharing established by <a ng-href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14" target="_new">Article 14</a> of the Nagoya Protocol, as part of clearing-house mechanism under <a ng-href="https://www.cbd.int/convention/articles/default.shtml?a=cbd-18" target="_new">Article 18, paragraph 3</a> of the Convention. The ABSCH is a key tool for facilitating the
                  implementation of the Nagoya Protocol by enhancing legal certainty, clarity, and transparency on procedures for access and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along the value chain, including through the internationally recognized certificate of compliance (IRCC). By making relevant information regarding ABS available, the ABSCH offers opportunities for connecting providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.</p>

                <h3 id="about-bg">Background</h3>
                <p> <a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/" target="_new_">The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing (ABS)</a> was negotiated in order to provide greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge by: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Establishing more predictable conditions for access to those resources; and</li>
                  <li>Helping to ensure benefit-sharing when genetic resources leave the contracting Party providing the genetic resources.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Researchers and businesses need legal clarity, certainty and transparency when accessing genetic resources and/or associated traditional knowledge. Without such legal certainty, potential users of genetic resources and/or associate
                  traditional knowledge could be less eager to invest in bioprospecting and researching activities, as their activities may lead to controversy and allegations of misappropriation or misuse of these resources or knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>Providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, on the other hand, want to ensure that benefits arising from the utilization of their resources are shared in a fair and equitable manner once the resource or knowledge
                  leaves the country.</p>
                <div class="well">

                  <h5>What Providers want:</h5>
                  <li>Control over access to their own genetic resources (GR) and traditional knowledge (TK)</li>
                  <li>Ensure that users comply with all conditions set in mutual agreed terms (MAT)</li>
                  <li>Assurance that the entitled benefits arising from utilization are received in accordance with MAT</li>

                  <h5> What Users want:</h5>
                  <li>Access to GR and associated TK</li>
                  <li>A clear understanding about how to access GR and TK</li>
                  <li>Legal certainty for utilizing GR and TK when due process has been followed</li>

                  <h5>What everybody wants:</h5>
                  <li>Fair and equitable sharing of benefits</li>
                  <li>Sustainable use of biodiversity</li>
                  <li>Conservation of biodiversity</li>
                </div>

                <p>The Nagoya Protocol's provisions on access, benefit-sharing and compliance provide a framework that aims to address the concerns of both users and providers. However, in order to translate the Nagoya Protocol into practice, Parties need
                  to create the necessary conditions and take the measures required by the Protocol to ensure that a national framework is in place to implement ABS at the national level and enable the development of ABS agreements for the benefit of all
                  involved in the process.   It is in this context and with this aim that Parties to the CBD included <a ng-href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14" target="_new">Article 14 </a> in the Nagoya Protocol, which establishes
                  an Access and Benefit Sharing Clearing House (ABSCH). 
                  
                  </p>

                <p>The Nagoya Protocol establishes the ABSCH, as part of the clearing-house mechanism of the Convention, as a means for sharing information related to access and benefit-sharing, and in particular its goal is to provide access to information
                  made available by each Party relevant to the implementation of the Protocol. </p>

                <p>The ABSCH allows countries to share information on procedures for accessing genetic resources and monitor the utilization of the resources along the value chain. The ABSCH plays a key role in enhancing the legal certainty and transparency
                  that both providers and users of genetic resources, as well as associated traditional knowledge, are looking for.</p>

                <div class="well">
                  <h5>The ABSCH is helping to make the ABC’s of ABS a reality</h5>
                  <li><strong>A</strong>ccess – Enhancing legal certainty, transparency and clarity on how to access genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.</li>
                  <li><strong>B</strong>enefit-sharing – Contributing to increase opportunities for sharing benefits from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.</li>
                  <li><strong>C</strong>ompliance – Assisting to ensure compliance with ABS measures and transparency in monitoring the utilization of genetic resources through the value chain.</li>
                </div>

                <p>A fully functional ABSCH also represents a major step in achieving <a translation-url href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/strategic-plan/targets/T16-quick-guide-en.pdf" target="_new">Aichi Biodiversity Target 16</a>, which provides that by 2015, the Nagoya Protocol is in force and operational, consistent with national legislation.</p>

                <p><a ng-href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14" target="_new">Article 14</a>, of the Nagoya Protocol, establishes the ABSCH, as part of the clearing-house mechanism of the Convention, as a means for sharing information related to access and benefit-sharing. In particular its goal is to provide access to information made available, particularly by Parties, on: procedures for access and monitoring the utilization of genetic resources.
                </p>

                <p>In practical terms, the sharing of information related to ABS is done through an website (http://absch.cbd.int) designed to enable, primarily Parties, but also non-Parties, indigenous people and local communities (IPLCs), international and non-governmental organizations, research institutions and businesses to make information available in an organized global repository.</p>

                <p>In order to enhance certainty, clarity and transparency in access and benefit-sharing the Protocol identifies certain essential information, as well as, additional information to be made available through the ABSCH. For more information please see:

              <section class="about-section" id="about-why">
                <h1>What does it do</h1>

                <p id="about-why1">
                  <h3>Facilitates connections between users and providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge. </h3></p>
                <p>The ABSCH allows providers to share information on contacts, procedures and requirements for accessing genetic resources and traditional knowledge. Users can use the ABSCH to easily find information how to access these resources in an organized manner, and all in one convenient location. </p>

                <p>By providing access to reliable information the ABSCH facilitates the connection between users and providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore promotes opportunities to develop fair and equitable ABS agreements.</p>

                <p id="about-why2">
                  <h3>Helps users to comply with national ABS measures and requirements.</h3></p>
                <p>By sharing reliable information regarding national procedures and requirements on ABS, countries can help users of their  genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge understand and follow ABS rules and facilitate users’ compliance with national legislation.</p>

                <p id="about-why3">
                  <h3>Provides tools to help countries monitor the utilization of genetic resources.</h3></p>
                <p>Through a centralized and standardized system the ABSCH plays a key role helping providers monitor how their genetic resources are being used throughout the value chain. When a provider country grants access to a genetic resource and publishes information on the permit or its equivalent, the ABSCH automatically generates an internationally recognized certificate of compliance (IRCC). </p>
                <p>The IRCC provides evidence a permit or its equivalent was issued and that the user has complied with the provider country's ABS rules and procedures. The IRCC can facilitate
                   users of genetic resources to provide the required information to the checkpoints established along the value chain. The information collected or received by checkpoints is then published on the ABSCH in a format called a checkpoint communiqué (CPC). The ABSCH makes this information publicly available and also sends the checkpoint communiqué, as an email, to alert all those involved in the process, and most importantly the Party providing prior informed consent (the provider country), to inform them of the utilization taking place. These tool have been set up in this way in order to allow for monitoring to be possible even when genetic resources leave the provider country's jurisdiction.</p>

                <p id="about-why4">
                  <h3>Offers reliable and up-to-date information. </h3></p>
                <p>The information available on the ABSCH follows secure publishing procedures. These procedures ensure that users have access to accurate information on ABS, making the process of access and utilization of genetic resources more fair, transparent and reliable.</p>

                  <h3>Parties and Non-Parties </h3> By publishing national information on the ABSCH, Parties to the Nagoya Protocol, and other governments, help both users and providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge. Users can find the information they need
                  to access genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, while providers will find tools to monitor the utilization of these resources. Parties have an obligation to use the ABSCH to share <a ng-href="#" scroll-to="submit-obligations">certain information of particular importance to the implementation of the Protocol</a>. Non-Parties to the Protocol are encouraged to share information through the ABSCH under the same conditions as Parties do.</p>


                <p id="about-who2">
                  <h3>Indigenous people and local communities (IPLCs)</h3> IPLCs can use the ABSCH to share information on how to access traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources, such as community protocols and procedures, and customary laws. They can also access and contribute to the ABSCH with awareness-raising and capacity-building materials on ABS in their own indigenous languages. </p>


                <p id="about-who3">
                  <h3>Private sector and research institutions </h3> Private sector and research institutions utilizing or seeking access to genetic resources can also benefit from the ABSCH by finding reliable and up-to-date information on how to access genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge. They can also use the ABSCH to share information on the model contractual clauses, codes of conduct, guidelines and best practices that they have developed. </p>


                <p id="about-who4">
                  <h3>Organizations involved in capacity-building for the Nagoya Protocol  </h3> Organizations involved in capacity-building for the Nagoya Protocol can share capacity-building resources and materials and information on their projects or activities, including lessons learned from their implementation. In exchange,
                  they are able to access information on projects or resources registered by other actors, and therefore, create opportunities for capitalizing best practices and developing coordinated approaches to building and developing capacity.</p>


                <p id="about-who5">
                  <h3> International and non-governmental organizations and others   </h3> International and non-governmental organizations and others can raise awareness and promote capacity building on ABS through the ABSCH. The ABSCH offers a space to share materials, general literature, and learning material related to ABS and the
                  Nagoya Protocol. These resources can contribute to promote ratification and implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, as well as increase opportunities for collaboration among the ABS community. </p>

                              a countries legal framework on ABS, especially when information is spread out across several different measures. The ABS measures matrix also allows 
                              the user to select which ABS measures they wish to view in the matrix.

                            On the search page, records are organized into three categories (national records, reference records and SCBD records) and displayed in separate tabs. 
                            All record categories can be searched simultaneously by using a combination of free-text filters and predefined filters. 
                            By default, no filters are set and all records are displayed under each record category tab. 
                            The search results can be narrowed down using combinations of filters giving users the flexibility to retrieve a very wide or a very narrow set of results.
                            The filters available are: free text (user entered text), record type, Party status, keywords, countries, regions and groups and the date the record was published. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each time a filter is selected, the search will be executed and the active filter will appear at the top of search page. 
                            Simply click on an active filter to remove it from the search. On the same page, below the filters, you will find the search results. 
                            The search results are separated by record category and displayed under separate tabs.  This is done to maintain a clear distinction 
                            between categories of records with a view to reduce the possibility confusing a national record, submitted by the government, with a 
                            reference record, which can be submitted by any registered user. Records are also color coded to reinforce its record category: 
                            <strong><span class="color-blue">blue = national records</span>, <span class="color-orange">orange = reference records</span>, <span style="font-weight:normal;">and</span> <span class="color-grey">grey = SCBD managed records</span></strong>.

                      <p> 
                          Each record published in the ABSCH is assigned a distinct code called a unique identifier (UID). A UID is a combination of characters and numbers used 
                          to uniquely distinguish the records on the ABSCH. For example, it looks something like this: ABSCH-IRCC-MX-123456-1. Each time a record is updated the last number of the UID, 
                          called the revision number, is also increased by 1 indicating a new version. This allows amendments to records to be tracked and provide greater transparency.  The UID 
                          can be a useful way to locate and keep track of records, as well as, to link ABSCH records to information contained in a separate  database. This can be helpful, for example, 
                          to make links between an IRCC and a national permit or its equivalent, which can contain additional and confidential information not available on the ABSCH.  
                      </p>
                      <div class="well">
                          <h5>Searching by Unique Identifiers</h5>
                          A unique identifier (UID) can be typed into the search and used as a filter either to find a particular record or to get a list of records that reference a particular record.   
                          For example, this can be useful if you were looking for all IRCCs issued by a specific CNA. To carry out this particular search you could select the national record type: “Internationally Recognized Certificate of Compliance” from the set of predefined national record filters and enter the UID of the competent national authority as a free text filter. The UID can be entered with or without the revision number (the last set of digits that make up the UID).

                          If revision number is included then only the records that reference that specific version of the CNA will be returned. When the revision number is omitted from the 
                          search filter then all records that make reference to any published version of that CNA will be returned.

                <p>
                  The ABSCH plays a key role in the implementation of the Protocol and it is crucial that Parties, non-Parties, indigenous people and local communities, as well as relevant stakeholders participate by publishing the relevant information on the ABSCH. Participation, particularly from Parties, to publish required and relevant  
                  information on the ABSCH is a key step to operationalize the Protocol at the national level. An ABSCH populated with relevant information will be a useful 
                 and effective tool to facilitate the implementation of the Protocol.
                 </p>
                 <p>We kindly invite you to share any relevant information through the ABSCH that can support the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol. In doing so, you will be helping to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <strong>Non-Parties:</strong> <a ng-href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-24" target="_new">Article 24</a> of the Protocol provides that Parties shall encourage non-Parties to adhere to the Protocol and to contribute appropriate information to the ABSCH, this includes publishing records in the ABSCH. 
                </p>

The Secretariat operates a help desk to provide on-demand technical support, answer questions and receive feedback. When necessary the CBD Secretariat
                  can also provide online webinars and face-to-face trainings. Please contact us for more information.

                  types of information through the ABSCH. In addition to this essential information, the Protocol also identifies other useful types of information that are to be made available through the ABSCH. Non-Parties are encouraged to make information
                  available under the same conditions as Parties.
                  <br><br>
                  <a ng-href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14" target="_new">Article 14, paragraph 2</a> describes the mandatory information Parties to the Nagoya Protocol are required to make available in the ABSCH, as the following:

                  <p>The NFP is responsible to liaise with the Secretariat and make available information on procedures for accessing genetic resources and establishing mutually agreed terms, including information on competent national authorities, relevant
                    indigenous and local communities and relevant stakeholders (<a ng-href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-13" target="_new">Article 13, paragraph 1</a>). The NFP must be designated or modified by completing an
                    <a href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/doc/commonformats/ABSCH-NFP.doc" target="_new_">official designation form</a> offline and sending it (by fax, email or post) to the CBD Secretariat. 
                   </p><p>
                    In order to make information available in the ABSCH the NFP is responsible for designating a single person responsible for approving the publication of all national records. This role is referred to as the publishing authority. The NFP can designate themselves as the publishing authority if desired.
                  </p>
               
                  <h5 id="about-rolesPA"><u><i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> The Publishing Authority (PA)</u></h5>
                  <p> The single person responsible for publishing all national records in the ABSCH. The publishing authority can publish records directly in the ABSCH. They can also designate one or more national authorized users (NAUs) to assist them in preparing draft records for their publication in the ABSCH on behalf of their country. The publishing authority will have to approve all records submitted by NAUs. 
                </p>
                <p> Non-Parties are encouraged to share all relevant ABS information through the ABSCH in the same conditions as Parties. Therefore, Non-Parties must also designate a PA in order to publish national information.
                </p>
                  <p>The PA is responsible for:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Authorizing the publication of all national records registered in the ABSCH;</li>
                      <li>Ensuring that the information made available on the ABSCH is complete, relevant and kept up-to-date; and</li>
                      <li>Ensuring that no confidential information is published in the ABSCH. The ABSCH does not host any confidential information and all information published in the ABSCH is publicly available and can be accessed by the general public.
                      </li>
                      <li>Managing the designation of the national authorized users (NAUs)</li>
                    </ul>

                  <h5 id="about-rolesNAU"><u><i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> National authorized users (NAUs)</u></h5>
                  <p>Countries may also designate one or more national authorized users (NAUs). The function of NAUs is to assist the publishing authorities in the preparation of draft national records. National authorized users can create and manage draft
                    records for their country and send them as requests to the publishing authority for publication.</p>
                    <p> For example, if may be useful to designate a checkpoint as a NAU and enable them to submit checkpoint communiqués to the publishing authority for approval and publication on the ABSCH. </p>

                
                <h4 id="about-rolesUsers">2. Registered users</h4>
                <p>
                  Anyone can sign-up for a CBD account and submit reference records to the ABSCH. This gives all stakeholders, such as, indigenous people and local communities, academia, non-governmental organizations, research institutions, and the private sector, the opportunity  to contribute relevant ABS information and to create a community where knowledge and best practices are shared to support the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol. The Secretariat, acts as the publishing authority for reference records and is responsible for validating all reference records before
                  final publication in the ABSCH. Although, registered users do not publish reference records directly, they should ensure the information they submit is correct, non-confidential, complete and up-to-date.
                </p>

                <h4 id="about-rolesPublic">3. Non-registered users  </h4>
                <p>
                  A CBD account is not required to access the information published on the ABSCH. All published information is made publicly available through the search and country profiles.

                <h1>Common formats</h1>
                <p>
                  The ABSCH operates based on information submitted under common formats. Common formats are standardized forms that facilitate submission and retrieval of information in a harmonized manner. The ABSCH common formats make use of controlled vocabularies and metadata in order to facilitate a consistent registering and search of information in the ABSCH.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The common formats differentiate between mandatory and non-mandatory information. Some fields are mandatory to ensure that the record contains the minimum information necessary for displaying records consistently. The common formats are also designed to be flexible and provide for opportunities to include additional information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Common formats are available to be completed online on the ABSCH website and offline in MS word format. Offline versions can be downloaded from the links below:

                  The Secretariat maintains a training website for the ABSCH which is functionally identical to the real ABSCH website except that it operates in an isolated environment. The training website is meant to support trainings and workshops by providing users with a safe
                  place where they can submit “practice” records and get familiarized with the functionalities without interfering with the real ABSCH website or real information.
                  <br><br> The training website is clearly identified by its orange striped background and "ABSCH TRAINING" written in bold lettering across the header of the each page. Emails sent from the training environment, as well as, records stored
                  in the training database are also clearly identified as coming from the training environment. The unique identifier for records stored in the training database will start with "ABSCHTRG" to indicate a training record, for example, ABSCHTRG-IRCC-MX-123456-1.

                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>
                        Provisions of the Nagoya Protocol work together to create a system to monitor utilization of genetic resources. The goal of this system is to inform and alert the appropriate authorities in both the provider country (country granting access
                        to the genetic resource) and user country (country where the utilization is taking place), on events related to the utilization of genetic resources. The ABSCH forms part of a feedback loop that allows, in particular, provider
                        countries access to the information related to the utilization of their genetic resources even when utilization happens outside of their jurisdiction. The information made available to the ABSCH can be used to help assess whether
                        the user is utilizing the genetic resource in compliance with the ABS requirements and domestic regulations of the provider country and can help to ensure the resulting benefits are being duly shared.
                        <br><br> Parties are required to establish certain entities that play an important role to support the system to monitor the utilization of genetic resources set out by the Protocol. To successfully operationalise the monitoring
                        system facilitated by the ABSCH, each Party must implement the Nagoya Protocol effectively at a national level and make available the required information to the ABSCH.

                    <h1>Key entities and concepts involved in monitoring genetic resources through the ABSCH</h1>
                    <p>
                        The information below provides an overview of the key entities and concepts involved in monitoring genetic resources through ABSCH:
                        <br><br>


                        <strong>Parties:</strong>  To successfully operationalize the monitoring system facilitated by the ABSCH, it is important that each Party implement the Nagoya Protocol effectively at a national level and make available the required information to the ABSCH.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>The ABSCH:</strong> The ABS Clearing-House (ABSCH) is the main tool setup by the Protocol to share information and facilitate monitoring utilization of genetic resources. Established in <a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14" target="_new">Article 14</a>, the ABSCH is a mechanism to share information
                        relevant to ABS in order to enhance the necessary conditions for ABS to happen, namely: access, benefit-sharing, and compliance. The ABSCH also transmits information in order to alert the relevant authorities when information related to monitoring the utilization of genetic resources (IRCC and CPC) is made available.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Users (of genetic resources):</strong> Users are responsible for sharing the benefits derived from genetic resources with the providers. They seek access to genetic resources for a wide range of purposes, from basic research
                        to the development of new products. They are a diverse group, including botanical gardens, industry researchers such as pharmaceutical, agriculture and cosmetic industries, collectors and research institutes. To gain access, users
                        must first get permission (known as prior informed consent or PIC) from the provider country and establish an agreement (known as mutually agreed terms or MAT) to share the resulting benefits equitably.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Utilization/Use of genetic resources:</strong> Utilization of genetic resources (defined in <a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-2" target="_new">Article 2 (c)</a>) whether from plants, animals
                        or micro-organisms, refers to the process of researching their beneficial properties and using them to increase scientific knowledge and understanding, or to develop commercial products.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Provider Country (country providing prior informed consent):</strong> The Party responsible for granting prior informed consent (PIC) and establishing mutually agreed terms (MAT) and issuing a national permit or equivalent
                        to the user for the specific genetic resources is referred to as the provider country. They also are responsible for submitting information on the national permit or equivalent to the ABSCH in order to constitute an IRCC as evidence
                        that the genetic resources has been accessed with PIC and MAT has been established in accordance with the ABS requirements of the provider country (<a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-6" target="_new">Article 6, paragraph 3(e)</a>).
                        <br><br> The provider country will receive information (in the form of checkpoint communiqués made available in the ABSCH) gathered from the user at checkpoints in the country where the genetic resources are being used. The provider
                        country can use the information provided by checkpoint communiqué to locate the original national permit or equivalent. This way the provider can consult the national permit, which may contain confidential information, and compare
                        this information against the information provided in the checkpoint communiqué. In case of any doubt or discrepancy to whether the genetic resource is being used in accordance with prior informed consent (PIC) and the established
                        mutually agreed terms (MAT), the provider can take appropriate measures and contact the user or the country where utilization is taking place in order to cooperate bilaterally on the resolution of any potential issues of misappropriation.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>User Country (country where utilization is taking place):</strong> The User Country refers to the country responsible for the jurisdiction in which utilization of a genetic resource is taking place. All Parties are responsible
                        for designating effective checkpoints and ensuring the information provided by users of genetic resources at their checkpoints is made available to the ABSCH. Designated authorities of the user country can also receive the information
                        coming from their own checkpoints about how genetic resources are being used within their jurisdiction. This allows user countries to establish a channel of communication with provider countries, and if desired, to take steps to
                        verify that users of genetic resources under their jurisdiction are in compliance with ABS measures and to cooperate in cases of alleged violation.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Checkpoints (CP):</strong> Parties are to designate effective checkpoints along the value chain, that are to collect or receive information provided by users related to the utilization of genetic resources as described
                        in <a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-17" target="_new">Article 17</a> of the Protocol. The information collected or received by the checkpoints is meant to inform and alert relevant authorities,
                        and above all, authorities in the provider country as to how their genetic resources are being used. The information collected or received at checkpoints is made available as a record on the ABSCH called a Checkpoint Communiqué
                        (CPC).
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Internationally Recognized Certificate of Compliance (IRCC):</strong> Parties requiring prior informed consent (PIC) are to provide for the issuance of a permit or equivalent (
                        <a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-6" target="_new">Article 6, paragraph 3(e)</a>), at the time of access, and make this information available to the ABSCH (
                        <a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14" target="_new">Article 14, paragraph 2(c)</a>). When information on a national permit or equivalent is entered into the ABSCH and published, it becomes available
                        as an IRCC (<a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-17" target="_new">Article 17, paragraph 2</a>). An IRCC provides evidence that the user has accessed a genetic resource legally and in accordance
                        with prior informed consent and that mutually agreed terms have been established, as required by the domestic ABS legislation or regulatory requirements of the provider country (country providing prior informed consent) (<a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-17"
                            target="_new">Article 17, paragraph 3</a>).
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> The ABSCH does not host confidential information and therefore Publishing Authorities (PA) should take the utmost care to ensure that national records, in particular IRCCs and CPCs, do not contain
                        confidential information. Article 17, paragraph 4, provides that the IRCC shall contain some minimum information when it is not confidential. Technically, in the ABSCH, the mandatory fields of the IRCC and CPC allow the possibility
                        to avoid entering confidential information (either with checkbox indicating the information for the field is confidential or by the use of a free text field giving the submitter the flexibility to provide information that is not
                        confidential).

                    <h1>The flow of information through the ABSCH to support monitoring the utilization of genetic resources</h1>
                    <p>
                        <h3>STEP 1: Issuing and national permit or its equivalent and constituting the Internationally Recognized Certificate of Compliance (IRCC)</h3> Utilization of genetic resources (defined in <a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-2" target="_new">Article 2 (c)</a>) whether from plants, animals or micro-organisms, refers to the process of researching
                        their beneficial properties and using them to increase scientific knowledge and understanding, or to develop commercial products. Users of genetic resources from the scientific or business community may seek access for scientific
                        research or product development. To gain access, users must first get permission (known as prior informed consent or PIC) from the provider country. In addition, the provider and the user must negotiate an agreement (known as mutually
                        agreed terms or MAT) to share the resulting benefits equitably.
                        <br><br> The information made available on the ABSCH can help potential users of genetic resources understand the ABS requirements and institutional arrangements in place in a provider country. The ABSCH also provides contact information
                        for ABS national focal points. ABS national focal points can help facilitate access and clarify the requirements and procedures in place in their countries in order to access to genetic resources and/or the associated traditional
                        knowledge.
                        <br><br> Competent national authorities (CNA) are bodies established by governments and are responsible for granting users access to their genetic resources, and representing providers on a local or national level. CNAs are responsible
                        for granting prior informed consent (PIC) and establishing mutually agreed terms (MAT), and issuing a national permit or equivalent to the user for the specific genetic resources. Parties are required to submit information on the
                        permits they issue to the ABSCH in order to constitute an internationally recognized certificate of compliance (IRCC).
                        <br><br> When the information on the permit or its equivalent is published in the ABSCH, an internationally recognized certificate of compliance (IRCC) is constituted. One of the responsibilities of the publishing authority is
                        to ensure that no confidential information is published when constituting an IRCC on the ABSCH.
                        <br><br> Once published the ABSCH will email a copy of the IRCC to:
                        <li style="list-style: none;">(a) the national focal point and the competent national authority or authorities of the country responsible for issuing the permit or its equivalent; </li>
                        <li style="list-style: none;">(b) the provider (entity that holds the right to grant access to the genetic resources) of the genetic resource, if this information is not confidential; and </li>
                        <li style="list-style: none;">(c) the person or entity that was granted prior informed consent (the user), when not confidential.</li>
                        <br> In the process of monitoring the utilization of genetic resources or associated traditional knowledge it can be important when determining whether the genetic resource is being used in accordance with prior informed consent
                        (PIC) and mutually agreed terms (MAT) that the provider country is able to trace each IRCC back to the original permit or equivalent (which may contain confidential information). Each IRCC that is publish is assigned a unique identifier
                        called the UID. The UID can be useful to link the national permit or equivalent to the IRCC. The unique reference or identifier of the national permit or equivalent can also be saved in the IRCC record format.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h3>STEP 2: Utilization of the genetic resources </h3> Monitoring the utilization of genetic resource to ensure benefits are shared an ABS requirements have been met can be difficult, especially when the utilization takes place outside of the provider’s jurisdiction. The ABSCH supports
                        the implementation of the provisions of the protocol by establishing a feedback loop that provides information on the utilization genetic resources to the relevant entities and authorities. By making information available on the
                        ABSCH related to utilization of genetic resources at checkpoints, authorities in both provider and users countries can be kept up-to-date in a transparent manner on the utilization of genetic resources.
                        <br><br> Parties to the protocol are required to designate effective checkpoints. Effective checkpoints are located a key places along the value chain where information can be collected or received from users related to the utilization
                        of genetic resources. Some possible examples of checkpoints are the places where a user would need to go to and provide pertinent information when undertaking research and development on a genetic resource, when claiming a right
                        in relation to the innovation made from such research and development, or when commercializing any resultant product.
                        <br><br> When a user encounters a checkpoint they will need to provide certain key information related to prior informed consent (PIC), to the source of the genetic resource, to the establishment of mutually agreed terms (MAT)
                        and/or to the utilization of genetic resources, as appropriate (<a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-17" target="_new">Article 17, 1(a) (i)</a>) when it is not confidential. The internationally recognized
                        certificate (IRCC) which serves as evidence that the genetic resources which it covers has been accessed in accordance with PIC and that MAT have been established, already contains most of the key information and can help to facilitate
                        the information the user is to provide at a checkpoint.
                        <br><br> The information collected or received at checkpoints is made available as a record on the ABSCH called a Checkpoint Communiqué (CPC). The CPC, when an IRCC is not provided, require the user at the checkpoint to provide
                        similar key information related to PIC, MAT, the genetic resource, source country, utilization, and the person at the checkpoint. The additional information for the CPC, with the exception of source country, is entered in a free
                        text format which offers the flexibility to provide the necessary information to assist provider countries to monitor the utilization of their genetic resources while allowing for no confidential information to be entered in the
                        ABSCH.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h3>STEP 3: Receiving the checkpoint communiqué </h3> After publication on the ABSCH, the checkpoint communiqué (CPC) becomes publicly available, and is automatically sent to the following entities, as appropriate:
                        <li style="list-style: none;">(a) The designated national authority/ies of the user country as determined in the common format on checkpoints; </li>
                        <li style="list-style: none;">(b) The national focal point and the competent national authority/ies of the country providing of the genetic resource; and </li>
                        <li style="list-style: none;">(c) The person or entity that was granted prior informed consent, if this information is not confidential. </li>
                        <br> Although, each entity receiving the CPC has the option to take steps in order to determine if the utilization taking place is being done in accordance with the original permit (or its equivalent) and domestic ABS requirements of the provider
                        country, the provider country is best placed to assess the information received in the CPC and determine whether access to the genetic resource was properly obtained and being used and in accordance with the mutually agreed terms.
                        When the CPC contains a reference to an IRCC or national permit (or its equivalent) and the information on how the genetic resource is being used, the provider country will be able look up and consult the original national permit (or its equivalent) containing
                        any confidential information and compare this information against the information provided by the CPC and then decide to take appropriate measures or contact the user in case of doubt or discrepancy.
                        <br><br> Even when much of the required information is confidential, it is still valuable to the provider country that the CPC is published. As long as the CPC is published, even when the information is limited or confidential,
                        monitoring the utilization of their genetic resources can still be possible through bilateral communication and cooperation between the authorities in the user and provider countries. Parties are required to cooperate in the resolution
                        of situations related to possible non-compliance to ensure the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources are being shared, in a fair and equitable way, and that the conditions set out in PIC and MAT are met.

                                 annex</a>) provides that the Secretariat shall design the ABSCH to be interoperable and facilitate the exchange of information with other databases and systems, in particular Parties’ databases, as well as databases of other instruments and organizations.
                                 </p><p>
                                 With this aim, the Secretariat has developed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_new">application programming interface (API)</a>. The
                                 API is the main tool to facilitate interoperability and the exchange of information with other IT systems or databases, in particular the IT systems of Parties, as well as, of other instruments and organizations. The API provides a standard interface described by a set of standard protocols to facilitate interaction with computer systems. The API is meant to allow the seamless integration of the data and functions of the ABSCH into other systems in ways that best fit their own needs, workflows and technologies.
                                </p><p>
                                 Parties and others can make use of the API to avoid duplication in the submission of information to the ABSCH and, at the same time, create national or regional information systems that are fully compatible with the ABSCH. This may be particularly useful for domestic information systems containing information on permits or their equivalent or information collected or received to implement <a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-17" target="_new">Article 17</a> of the Protocol.

                <h1>ABSCH training website</h1>
                <p>
                  The Secretariat maintains a training website for the ABSCH which is functionally identical to the real ABSCH website except that it operates in an isolated environment. The training website is meant to support trainings and workshops by providing users with a safe
                  place where they can submit “practice” records and get familiarized with the functionalities without interfering with the real ABSCH website or real information.
                  <br><br> The training website is clearly identified by its orange striped background and "ABSCH TRAINING" written in bold lettering across the header of the each page. Emails sent from the training environment, as well as, records stored
                  in the training database are also clearly identified as coming from the training environment. The unique identifier for records stored in the training database will start with "ABSCHTRG" to indicate a training record, for example, ABSCHTRG-IRCC-MX-123456-1.
