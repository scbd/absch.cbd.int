                            The form consists of a series of questions mainly focused on those provisions of the Protocol that establish obligations

                            an asterisk. Each question is structured to select “Yes” or “No” (or in some cases, “Not applicable”).
                            Generally, these questions are followed by text-boxes where countries are encouraged to provide
                            details on the measures taken as well as to report on difficulties and challenges to implement
                            particular provisions. You can also provide further information on the issue by linking to existing
                            ABS Clearing-House records, websites or uploading documents. Your responses in the text-boxes
                            should be as relevant, succinct and clear as possible.

                        <p>Some questions are not strictly based on the provisions of the Protocol and are identified as voluntary.
                            They will contribute to the assessment and review of the effectiveness of the Protocol in the
                            context of Article 31 and to identify challenges and difficulties in implementing the Protocol.
