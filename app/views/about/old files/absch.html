          The Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House (ABS-CH) is a platform for exchanging information on access and benefit-sharing established by Article 14 of the Protocol, as part of Clearing-House under Article 18, paragraph 3 of the Convention. The ABS Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol, by enhancing legal certainty and transparency on procedures for access, and for monitoring the utilization of genetic resources along the value chain, including through the internationally recognized certificate of compliance. By hosting relevant information regarding ABS, the Clearing-House will offer opportunities for connecting users and providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.
