      <p>
          The categories of information available in the ABS-CH are divided into two major clusters:
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong class="color-blue">1. National records: </strong>
          The submission forms under the national records category allow Parties to publish relevant
          national information for the implementation of the Protocol. Only [designated users] can
          create and publish this type of records. The ABS-CH currently hosts the following national records:

              <li>Competent National Authority (CNA)</li>
              <li>Checkpoint (CP)</li>
              <li>Legislative, administrative or policy measures on access and benefit-sharing (MSR)</li>
              <li>Information on the permits or its equivalent  for constituting an internationally recognized certificate of compliance</li>
              <li>Information for the checkpoint communiqué (CPC)</li>
              <li>National websites and database (NDB)</li>
         </ul>
     </p>

      <p>
          <strong class="color-orange">2. Reference records: </strong>
          The submission forms under the “reference records” category allow the submission of information relevant to the
          Protocol from any registered user (e.g. Governments, representatives of indigenous and local communities, academia,
          nongovernmental organizations, research institutions, business representatives, etc.) to the Virtual Library of
          the ABS Clearing-House. The Secretariat is responsible for publishing all reference records.
