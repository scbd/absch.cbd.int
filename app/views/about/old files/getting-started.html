                 By publishing your national information on the ABSCH, Parties to the Nagoya Protocol and other Governments help both users and providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge to:
                <ul>
                    <li> connect users and providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge</li>
                    <li> support users to comply with your national ABS measures and requirements</li>
                    <li> monitor the utilization of genetic resources</li>
                    <li> contribute to making the ABSCH a global information hub for reliable and up-to-date ABS information</li>
               </ul>
                <b>Please note:</b> Non-Parties to the Protocol (other Governments) are encouraged to share all relevant ABS information through the ABSCH in the same conditions as Parties do.

                  <br/><br/>
                    <p>An essential and important step in order to be able to publish information on the ABSCH is to first designate a Publishing Authority (PA) for your country. The publishing authority is the single person responsible for approving the publication of  national records and ensuring that all information made available is complete, non-confidential, relevant, and up-to-date.</p>

                    <p>Important things to know about the publishing authority:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you are not sure who to designate as the publishing authority, the ABS national focal point can be designated as the publishing authority.</li>
                            <li>The publishing authority can be easily changed at any time.</li>
                            <li>A publishing authority is necessary in order to publish national records (including to submit the National Interim Report) on the ABSCH.</li> 
                        </ul>
                    </p>
