<p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>ESTABLISHING LEGAL FRAMEWORKS TO IMPLEMENT THE NAGOYA PROTOCOL</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">An IDLO-SCBD capacity building course, various dates available in 2016</p>

<p>Genetic resources are the raw ingredients for innovation in medicine, biotechnology, cosmetics, food and beverages, and more. The Nagoya Protocol is a global agreement that calls for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the utilization of genetic resources between those who use them and those that provide them. It aims to promote research and innovation on genetic resources while building incentives for their conservation and sustainable use for the benefit of development and human well-being.</p>

<p>Following the entry into force of the Nagoya Protocol in October 2014, many countries are now actively engaged in making the Protocol operational.&nbsp;An early challenge in the Protocol’s implementation is building the necessary capacity to enable countries to establish new or amend existing domestic ABS legislative, administrative and policy measures. Each country will need to define its own approach tailored to its own needs and priorities.</p>

<p>IDLO and the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD), with funding from the Japan Biodiversity Fund, are implementing a joint capacity-building program&nbsp;to support the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol. This course covers key themes and presents the latest knowledge available related to the establishment of domestic ABS legislative, administrative and policy measures. It is designed to build the capacity of lawyers and policy officers actively involved in designing and implementing domestic frameworks or advising on national processes to implement the Nagoya Protocol.</p>

<p>The course is composed of:</p>

<p> • Mandatory 4 week preparatory e-learning sessions to learn about the foundational concepts on ABS and Protocol implementation&nbsp;</p>

<p> • A 5-day interactive face-to-face workshop with sessions for peer-to-peer knowledge sharing, to develop tailored legal roadmaps to implementation, and to strengthen facilitation and communication skills&nbsp;</p>

<p> • Follow-up peer-to-peer learning and knowledge sharing through online networking and a discussion forum.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Expressions of interest are being accepted until 22 February 2016. Successful candidates will be notified by 28 March. Selected applicants</strong><strong style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 35.5556px;">&nbsp;from developing countries will receive funding support to cover travel and accommodation costs.</strong></p>
