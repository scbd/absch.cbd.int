By default, no filters are set and all records are displayed under each record category tab. The search results can be narrowed down using combinations of filters giving users the flexibility to retrieve a very wide or a very narrow set of results. The filters available are: free text (user entered text), record type, Party status, keywords, countries, regions and groups and the date the record was published." },

For example, this can be useful if you were looking for all IRCCs issued by a specific CNA. To carry out this particular search you could select the national record type: “Internationally Recognized Certificate of Compliance” from the set of predefined national record filters and enter the UID of the competent national authority as a free text filter. The UID can be entered with or without the revision number (the last set of digits that make up the UID). If revision number is included then only the records that reference that specific version of the CNA will be returned. When the revision number is omitted from the search filter then all records that make reference to any published version of that CNA will be returned." },
